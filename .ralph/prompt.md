# Task

You are improving the OpenHouse casino frontend with Framer Motion animations.

## Instructions

1. Read `.ralph/PROGRESS.md` - see what's done and what's next
2. If ALL items are complete, output exactly "RALPH_COMPLETE" and stop
3. Read `.ralph/SPEC.md` - detailed implementation guide
4. Pick the NEXT uncompleted item from PROGRESS.md
5. Implement it properly with TypeScript
6. Run `cd openhouse_frontend && npm run build` to verify
7. If build fails, fix the error
8. Update `.ralph/PROGRESS.md` - mark item complete

## Rules

- One feature per session
- Build must pass
- Don't break existing game functionality
- Use `framer-motion` (already installed)
- Keep animations snappy (under 300ms for micro-interactions)
- DO NOT git commit - only make local changes
- DO deploy to mainnet after build passes: `./deploy.sh`
